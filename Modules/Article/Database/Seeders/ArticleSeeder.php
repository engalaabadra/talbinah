            'description' => trans("articles.seeders.When faced with overthinking, our mind can seem like our worst enemy. Those are recurring thoughts
            Problems that we overthink wear us out without benefit. But there are ways to get rid of overthinking, maintain our mental health, and protect us from various disorders. Here are some recommendations and tips that can help you:
            1. Observe yourself and find out the cause of the problem:
            Next time you feel distracted, try to see how it affects your mood and general well-being. Do you feel angry, stressed, or guilty? Try to figure out the basic feeling behind those thoughts and what is the main reason behind it. Starting to treat any problem requires identifying its causes.
            2. Find ways to get rid of these thoughts.
            There are a variety of techniques that can help you take your mind off the thoughts that are controlling you. Some examples of these methods include: getting regular exercise, participating in a variety of social activities, strengthening relationships with family and friends, and pursuing hobbies and activities that you enjoy.
            3. Try relaxation and meditation exercises:
            Relaxation and meditation exercises have good benefits for mental and physical health. It helps you fight anxiety and stress, and helps you get rid of repetitive thoughts that are holding you back by redirecting your attention inward and forgetting about annoying situations and the anxiety they cause.
            4. Set clear goals and focus on priorities:
            Don't allow small problems to turn into major obstacles. Always think about what is important to you and set key priorities and goals. Don't let small thoughts and obstacles distract you from your main goal.
            5. Help others and cooperate with them:
            Trying to ease others' burdens and help them can help you see things in a different light. Think about what you can do to help someone who is going through a difficult time. Knowing that you have the power to help others and improve their lives can prevent negative thoughts from taking over your mind and give you something useful to focus on instead of repetitive thoughts.
            6. Identify and eliminate random negative thoughts.
            These random negative thoughts trigger fear and anger as an initial response to certain situations. You can get rid of them by using a notebook and writing down the situations that cause you anxiety and distraction. Then try to analyze the feelings you're going through and learn how to talk to yourself during those situations. Try to find an alternative to negative thoughts, eg think about things that might go well rather than things that might fail, etc.
            The first generates hope and enthusiasm, while the second generates fear and despair.
            7. Acknowledge your successes and be grateful for yourself.
            When you find yourself overwhelmed with negative thoughts, remember your successes and achievements, and focus on the positive aspects of your life, such as work and studies. Self-esteem and self-care is the first step in facing any psychological disorder.
            8. Stay focused.
            Repeated negative thoughts greatly affect focus and distract attention. So try to keep your focus on the main tasks and goals, and get rid of secondary thoughts that distract your mind and affect your performance in all aspects of your life.
            9. Don't hesitate to ask for help when needed.

            'description' => trans("articles.seeders.Feelings of sadness for no reason, is it possible? This question raises many questions, as sadness is usually linked to obvious reasons in many cases. But sometimes, a person feels sad and may reach the point of crying and depression for no apparent reason. The person searches in his mind for the reasons that led to this situation, but in the end he realizes that there is no direct reason for his sad feelings, which may complicate the problem and make him lose confidence in himself and his feelings. However, psychology provides another explanation for this sensitive psychological state, and this is what I will explain in the next article.
            Sadness without a cause in psychology
            In many cases, a person goes through experiences that make him wonder, Why do I feel sad for no reason?, as he tries to find a reason for his gloomy feelings, and this may push him to isolate and distance himself from others in order to hide his suffering and pain.
            Psychologists note that there are many signs associated with feeling sad that cannot be directly explained. The person may feel an urge to scream loudly and cry suddenly. He can also feel dissatisfied and restless, and is dominated by a strong desire to harm himself or others. He may suffer from feelings of guilt and lack of enjoyment of life.
            Psychology promotes the idea that there are many reasons behind these sad feelings, that the person affected may ignore them and think that they are for no reason. However, a psychotherapist can help him identify those causes and treat them, until the person returns to his normal state.
            sudden sadness
            The sudden sadness that a person feels may be due to either an obvious reason or obscure reasons that need to be explored. Among the top possible causes of sudden sadness:
            1. The loss of a dear or beloved person from the family or close associates, whether due to separation or death.
            2. Exposure to psychological trauma or an embarrassing situation.
            3. Seasonal depression that occurs in certain seasons such as winter or fall.
            4. Taking medications that cause side effects, including depression, such as acne medications and antivirals.
            5. Consuming alcohol and drugs can lead to depressive episodes.
            6. Discovering that a person has a serious illness that affects his psychological state.
            7. Exposure to verbal or physical violence.
            Does the constant feeling of sadness need treatment?
            Although the constant feeling of sadness is not a disease in itself, it is a symptom of other problems, whether psychological or physical. So, we must pay attention to these symptoms
            We take it seriously and do not neglect it, follow it up and set a timetable for its appearance and recurrence.
            Other symptoms that accompany feeling sad should also be noted, as their conjunction with other symptoms helps in diagnosing the condition. For example, sadness may accompany a person feeling weak and unwilling to do any activity, and he may feel exhausted, tired and lazy. He may also experience feelings of hopelessness, frustration, distress, and depression. He may lose focus and focus only on his sad feelings. He may refuse to eat and his appetite and weight will be significantly affected. He may suffer from insomnia and his sleep hours may be disturbed. May lose interest in hobbies and daily activities and lose passion.
            Crying for no reason in psychology
            The deep feelings of sadness that a person is trying to deal with may usually be associated with rapid and unjustified crying, as sensitive and emotional feelings cause the person to itch to cry over the slightest reason. And when a person wonders why he is sad for no reason, we must understand that there are many reasons that may be responsible for this condition. There may be organic causes as a result of health problems or hormonal changes. There may also be psychological reasons resulting from exposure to life pressures and the person being affected by various influences that increase stress and ultimately lead to increased sad feelings and crying.
            Therefore, we must agree that there is no sadness or crying without a reason, nor depression without a reason. Doctors and psychotherapists study human nature and determine the real causes of these cases, and accordingly, appropriate treatment begins.
            Feeling upset and depressed for no reason
            Although the question “Why do I feel sad for no reason” reflects the bewilderment of a person with a bad mental state, the reality is that there are a range of possible causes. Among the most prominent of these reasons:
            1. Sometimes sadness occurs as a result of the lack of some necessary elements in the body, which leads to a lack of serotonin and dopamine secretion, and thus depression occurs.
            2. Exposure to daily pressures and problems.
            3. Sleep disturbances and not getting enough rest and relaxation.
            4. The accumulation of nervous pressures and incurring them without expressing or concealing them, which eventually leads to bouts of anger and crying.
            5. Exposing the person to stress and excessive physical fatigue, and not obtaining periods of rest and relaxation that would enable him to bear the pressures.
            6. Unhealthy life habits and lack of exercise, which causes boredom, laziness and routine.
            7. Bad eating habits and excessive eating of unhealthy foods, which causes mood swings
            Yeh.
            8. Excessive smoking, alcohol and caffeine intake can lead to extreme mood swings.
            9. Malnutrition and not eating foods rich in vitamins that contribute to improving the psychological state, such as omega-3 acid, vitamin B, vitamin D and vitamin C.
            10. Living with people who suffer from psychological problems and who fill the environment with negative energy, which may be transmitted to the person affected by them.
            Therefore, sadness for no reason reflects the existence of hidden feelings within a person that he thinks do not exist and believes that his sadness is without reasons. However, psychiatry asserts that there is no sadness without a cause; The situations a person is exposed to on a daily basis transmit nerve signals to the conscious mind telling him that he is suffering from depression. Through the appearance of signs of grief, a person can realize the integrity of his subconscious mind and that he needs someone to listen to him, help him overcome his crisis, and direct him to ways to get rid of grief."),
